              Badapahad Dargah, also known as Peddagutta, is a revered shrine located on a hilltop near Varni, about 40 km from Nizamabad. It is one of the oldest Muslim pilgrimage sites in Telangana, believed to be built over 900 years ago in honor of Hazrat Syed Sadullah Hussaini. The dargah is visited by both Hindus and Muslims, symbolizing unity and faith. Pilgrims climb over 1000 steps to reach the shrine, enjoying scenic views along the way.
          The main significance of visiting Badapahad Dargah\*\* lies in its spiritual harmony, historical depth, and cultural importance
